# Zelda-My-Font-Website
A website based on the Sheikah language from Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I combined this font with some cryptography, linguistics, and math, including Caesar ciphers, the Vigenère cipher, and the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. There are three interconnected websites(Challenge 1, Challenge 2, and HTML) that use a mix of my font/language and a normal font. I have also added various hint buttons that help people translate and decode the passages, allowing them to find the password needed to move to the next page. I hope to teach people some basic linguistic and cryptographic properties.

## Demo URL

Website Link: [Stopwatch Web App](https://stopwatch-website-sage.vercel.app/)

## Features

1. Start, Pause, and Reset stopwatch  
2. Millisecond-level timing accuracy  
3. Clean, centered UI with dark theme  
4. Responsive layout for both mobile and desktop  
5. Real-time updates using `setInterval()`  
6. Start button becomes a resume button after stop is pressed  

## Built With

- HTML5 - structure
- CSS3 - styling and layout
- JavaScript - stopwatch logic and timing functionality

## How It Works

The stopwatch uses JavaScript `setInterval()` function to repeatedly update the display at fixed intervals of approximately 10 milliseconds. 

It tracks elapsed time by incrementing milliseconds, seconds, minutes, and hours over time. 

Each tick (interval) updates the DOM, which keeps the display in sync with the interval counters.

The app simulates a stopwatch by incrementing values at fixed intervals.
